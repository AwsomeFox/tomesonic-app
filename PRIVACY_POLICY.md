**The Short Version:** We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal information. Period.

- We are not involved in this connection and cannot access it

### Local Storage
- App settings and preferences are stored locally on your device
- Downloaded audiobooks are stored locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to our servers (because we don't have any)

- Your audiobook library, progress, and bookmarks are managed by your AudiobookShelf server
- We have no access to your AudiobookShelf server or its data
- All synchronization happens directly between your device and your server
