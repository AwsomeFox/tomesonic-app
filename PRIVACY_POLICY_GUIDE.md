# Privacy Policy Implementation Guide

## 📋 **Files Created**

1. **`PRIVACY_POLICY.md`** - Comprehensive markdown version for documentation
2. **`assets/privacy-policy.html`** - Web-ready HTML version for hosting

## 🌐 **Google Play Store Requirements**

Google Play requires a **publicly accessible privacy policy URL** for apps that:
- Access sensitive permissions (✓ TomeSonic does)
- Handle user data (✓ Even though you don't collect it, you still need one)

## 🚀 **How to Host Your Privacy Policy**

### **Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free)**

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   # In your GitHub repository settings
   # Go to Settings → Pages
   # Select "Deploy from a branch"
   # Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   ```

2. **Your Privacy Policy URL will be:**
   ```
   https://awsomefox.github.io/audiobookshelf-app/assets/privacy-policy.html
   ```

3. **Test the URL** to ensure it loads properly

### **Option 2: Your Own Website**
If you have a personal website, upload `privacy-policy.html` to your server.

### **Option 3: Free Static Hosting**
- **Netlify:** Drag and drop the HTML file
- **Vercel:** Connect your GitHub repo
- **GitHub Gist:** Create a public gist with the HTML content

## 📱 **Using in Google Play Console**

1. **Go to Play Console → Your App → Store Listing**
2. **Scroll to "Privacy Policy" section**
3. **Enter your hosted URL:**
   ```
   https://awsomefox.github.io/audiobookshelf-app/assets/privacy-policy.html
   ```

## 🔍 **Key Features of Your Privacy Policy**

### **Privacy-First Messaging:**

- ✅ Transparent about required permissions
- ✅ Covers third-party services (Google Play, Android Auto, etc.)

### **Legal Compliance:**

## 📝 **Customization Options**

### **Update Contact Information:**
Replace GitHub links with your preferred contact method:
```html
<!-- In privacy-policy.html -->
<a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">your-email@example.com</a>
```

### **Add Your Website:**
If you have a personal or company website:
```html
<p>Visit our website: <a href="https://yourwebsite.com">yourwebsite.com</a></p>
```

### **Branding:**
The HTML version already includes TomeSonic branding with your app colors.

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Keep It Updated:**
- Update the "Last Updated" date when making changes
- Notify users of significant policy changes
- Maintain version history

### **Consistency:**
- Privacy policy should match your actual app practices
- If you add analytics later, update the policy first
- Keep app store descriptions consistent

### **Backup:**
- Keep copies of both markdown and HTML versions
- Consider version control for policy changes
- Test links regularly to ensure they remain accessible

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Choose hosting method** (GitHub Pages recommended)
2. **Upload privacy-policy.html** to your chosen platform
3. **Test the URL** to ensure it loads correctly
4. **Add URL to Google Play Console** in store listing
5. **Update app if needed** to reference privacy policy
